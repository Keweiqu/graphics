Design:
1.left and right arrow for moving Ship/Self arounf
2. space key for shooting
3. ',' and '.' key for changing angles.
4. 'd' for pause and 'r' for resume

NOTE:
During pause the legion still flips each alien, this is by design, not a bug. I really like the way it looks.


Extra Credit Features:
1. shooting with angles
2. Forts/ Shields
3. Mutiple lives and the number of lives left are indicated on the top left corner.
4. Win / Lose screen, when winning "WIN" in green show up with black background, where as when losing, "LOSE" shows up
in red.
5. score system. Score is recorded and shows up on the top right corner.


What could be done better:

1. During half way, I started to realize that the way to render legion can be generalized -- a 5 * 11 matrix, so I created a more sophisticated
version of self, which is compose of a 3* 3 matrix. Then I render letters and numbers in the same way. However, as the
design was not abstract enough, some collision checking functions are actually duplicated. I would like to refactor and 
abstract them if time permits

2. #define all integers. I know that there are a few integers scattered in the code, that I havent create macro for. Again
if time permitting, I would like to refactor this aspect as well.

3. extern variables

4. The scenario for losing game because aliens reach the bottom of the screen -- currently it is hard coded in respect to the center of 
legion. It would be better to consider the last visible row see if it touches the base line.
